In Guided play, GMs control Enemies. Enemies have a sequence of prioritized Actions and a Zone that describes how they use their Move. Enemies also have a Morale score, as described below.

### NPC Distance

| d6 | Distance from You |
|----|-------------------|
| 1 | Close |
| 2-4 | Near |
| 5-6 | Far, if possible |

### NPC Reaction

| 2d6 | Reaction |
|-----|----------|
| 2-3 | Violent, attacks immediately |
| 4-6 | Hostile, likely to attack |
| 7-9 | Untrusting, possibly confused |
| 10-11 | Neutral, open to leaving peacefully |
| 12+ | Friendly, willing to become an Ally |

You can also use the Reaction table when determining if you convince an Enemy to end [[Combat]] or for other interactions, adding the Hero's Presence to the 2d6 roll on a passed [[Influence]] Check.

## Zone
To determine how an Enemy acts during [[Combat]], it is given a Zone:

**Frontline:** Moves Close for [[Melee]] Attacks.
**Midline:** Moves Close to Attack, then Move to Near. If a Midliner is at half HP or lower, it acts as Backline.
**Backline:** Stays Far from opposing forces for [[Ranged]] Attacks and Casts.

## Morale
Enemies make Morale Checks at the following times during a [[Combat]]:
- The first death in their Group occurs.
- Their HP is at half or less, or half their Group is [[Incapacitated]].

To check Morale, roll 2d6 and consult the Group's Leader's statblock. If the 2d6 result is higher than its Morale, the Group fails and either retreats or surrenders.

## Action Gambit
Actions are arranged in order of priority, so you can assume it is always using the top-most viable Action. A GM can just choose the Action.

**Combo:** It can use all of the Actions shown at the same time with one Action.
**[[Melee]] Attack:** Assumes Close unless indicated.
**[[Ranged]] Attack:** Assumes Far unless indicated.
**Cast:** Enemies do not track Mana. Instead, they either have limited uses or Recharges.

### Recharge
Once it uses the Ability or Action, it can't use it again until after the indicated duration.
