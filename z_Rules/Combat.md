name: Combat
type: rule

Combat begins when a Being physically harms another. [[Time]] is measured in Rounds, which are broken up into Turns for each Group in the Combat. Combatants will be placed in one of these Groups.

**Turn Order:** Heroes take the first Turn. If surprised, the Heroes must pass a [[Detect]] Check. Those that fail can't act that first Turn.

> **Variant Rule: Rotation & Initiative**
> Groups that want more order to Rounds can use the following methods to determine Turn Order:
> **Rotation:** Heroes act clockwise from the GM.
> **Initiative:** Go in order of Heroes with the lowest Reflex Save to the highest.

## Actions
You can take your Action at any point during the Turn, choosing from the Actions below, or in a way that isn't accounted for here.

**Attack:** Make an Attack Check with your Weapon, dealing its damage on a pass.
**Cast:** You cast a Spell.
**Hold:** Use an Action or Move on an Off-Turn.
**Jump:** Spend half your Speed to leap up to that distance horizontally.
**Rush:** Gain Speed this Turn equal to your Speed.
**Use:** Interact with or use an Object.

## Move
Your Speed is how far you can Move during your Turn, which you can break up as you like.

## Defending
You can either Block or Dodge attacks if you aren't [[Incapacitated]].

**Block:** Endure Save, which is Hindered if the attack is a [[Ranged]] attack.
**Dodge:** Reflex Save, which is Hindered if you are wearing Heavy [[Armor]].

If the Save passes, you ignore one of the attack's highest rolled damage dice.

## Ending Combat
Combat ends when every member of a Group is defeated, typically through one of the following means:

**Death:** All members of a Group are dead.
**Surrender:** A Group's surrender is accepted.
**Flee:** A Group successfully Retreats.

### Retreating
If a Group flees, they must spend their Action and Move doing so. Unless another Group is giving chase, the combat ends after this Turn.
