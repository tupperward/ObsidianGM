### Starting at Level 0
You can choose to start at Level 0, where you are a lowly vagabond who hasn't quite experienced the call to adventure. In doing so, follow these guidelines:
- Choose your Ancestry, Stats, and Gear.
- For Max HP, treat Level 0 as Level 1.
- Don't take a Class until Level 1.

## Leveling Up
Your advancements as a Hero are signified with a Level in your Class. Each time you gain a Level:
- Your Max HP increases.
- You gain new and improved Class Features.
- On Even Levels, increase a Stat by 1, to a max of 7.
- On Odd Levels after Level 1, you gain one Perk as shown in the Class table.

### Leveling Methods
There are two methods to determine when Heroes gain a Level: either the XP Questionnaire or Destiny.

**XP Questionnaire**
After each session, ask each of these questions and mark 1 XP for each "yes" you can give.
- Did you complete a Quest?
- Did you Fail and allow the Fail to resolve?
- Did you pass a Hindered Check?
- Did you make a discovery?
- Did you loot at least 50g of treasure?

**Destiny**
The GM may alternatively create a path for leveling, called a Destiny. A Destiny is 9 Milestones that mark major progressions in the Story. Each time a Milestone is completed, each of the Heroes gains a level.

### Class Features Pace

| Pace | XP/Level | Est. Campaign Length |
|------|----------|---------------------|
| Quick | 5 per Level | 2-5 Months |
| Normal | 5 x Level | 5-12 Months |
| Epic | 7 x Level | 1-2 Years |
| Saga | 10 x Level | 2+ Years |

The GM sets the pace at which you gain Levels.
