## The Dice
You'll need a four-sided (d4), six-sided (d6), eight-sided (d8), ten-sided (d10), twelve-sided (d12), and twenty-sided (d20) die.

**Cumulative Roll (xd6)**
Numbers before dice (such as 2d6) use that many dice for the roll, and add the dice together for the result.

**Exploding Roll (d6!)**
Exploding rolls use an exclamation mark, and add a bonus die of the same size if it rolls its highest value (ex: 6 on a d6!). It continues doing so on any bonus dice rolls as well.

**Countdown Dice (Cdx)**
Roll Countdown dice each Round. If it rolls a 1, it shrinks one size (ex: d6 to d4). A roll of 1 on a Cd4 ends the countdown.

**d66 Rolls**
Roll two d6. Use the first d6 for the tens value and the second d6 for the ones value.

## Checks
To make a Check, roll a d20 and compare the result against that Check's Difficulty:

**Crit:** d20 rolls an unmodified 20.
**Pass:** d20 rolls equal to or above Difficulty.
**Fail:** d20 rolls below Difficulty.

To determine this Difficulty, subtract the Check's Stat from 20. If you are Trained with the Check, double the Stat.

> Difficulty = 20 - (Stat (x2 if Trained))

### Crits
When you Crit, you gain 1 [[Luck]], which you can forgo for a benefit based on the Check:

**Attack/Cast:** Deal damage to the Target(s) equal to the Stat, or use the Crit benefit listed in the Spell.
**Save:** You aren't affected by what provoked the Save, and can use an Action.

### Favor & Hinder
Circumstances may Favor or Hinder a Check:

**Favored:** d20 roll with a d6 bonus.
**Hindered:** d20 roll with a d6 penalty.

Favor and Hinder cancel each other out 1-for-1, and they don't stack. A roll is either Favored or Hindered and only one d6 is rolled for either.

> Anything under the control of the GM does not roll for its Checks and [[Saves]]. They are assumed to pass unless the Heroes succeed.

## Stats
Stats range from 2 to 7, and determine your Passives, Attack Difficulties, Skill Difficulties, and [[Saves]].

- **Might:** Endurance, strength, and vitality.
- **Dexterity:** Agility, coordination, and reflex.
- **Awareness:** Accuracy, perception, and wisdom.
- **Reason:** Deduction, intelligence, and logic.
- **Presence:** Charisma, soul, and wit.
- **[[Luck]]:** Destiny, fate, and success.

## Hit Points & Damage
Hit Points (HP) indicate condition, stamina, and ability to avoid death. Damage causes you to lose HP.

### Damage
Damage is subtracted from the Hit Points (HP) of who takes the damage, and has a minimum of 0.

### Damage Source
Rather than specific damage types, the GM decides if an Ability applies to a source of damage. When you Attack with a Weapon, describe how you do, such as piercing with a sword or slashing. Spells are more specific, with [[Freeze]] being Cold, or [[Gas]]'s Poison stench.

### [[Armor]]/Immune/Weak
Beings can have [[Armor]], Immune, or Weak to certain damage, which affect it in the following ways:

**[[Armor]]:** Subtracted from Attack damage.
**Immune:** Unharmed by the damage.
**Weak:** Ignores [[Armor]] and Immune, and deals an extra damage die.

### Dying
Beings can die in any of the following ways:
- Their HP is reduced to 0,
- Their body is destroyed,
- They have 5 Fatigue.

Dead Beings can't regain HP.

> If your Hero dies, you are encouraged to make a new one and rejoin the party when possible. If your table can come up with a reason for why your Hero survived, that's also fine. Quick play and fun should be prioritized.
