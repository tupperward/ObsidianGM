name: Casting Spells
type: rule

To Cast a Spell, your hands must be open or holding a Trinket. When you do, determine:
1. Are you casting it to deal Damage, cause the Effect, or both? Choosing to only deal 1d6 damage or cause the Effect requires no Mana. Choosing both costs 1 Mana.
2. Who the Spell Targets with its Delivery.
3. How long it lasts, known as Duration.

> When you Cast a Spell, you don't make a Cast Check unless an unwilling Being is a Target.
## Damage
Spells with a Damage Base can be cast to deal d6 damage. You can spend Mana to increase the damage by 1d6 per Mana spent to do so.
## Effect
What it does, unless only Cast for damage.
## Delivery
Delivery determines Targets. If the delivery is an Area, it Targets everything in it unconditionally, unless you specify otherwise.

| Delivery | Cost | Increase |
|---|:---:|---|
| Aura | 2 | +1 per +5' to the radius |
| Cone | 2 | +2 per additional 5' of length |
| Cube | 1 | +1 per additional 5' cube |
| Imbue | 0 | +2 per additional Target |
| Glyph | 2 | -- |
| Line | 2 | +1 per 10' of extra length |
| Remote | 0 | +1 per additional Target |
| Sphere | 2 | +1 per +5' to the radius |
| Touch | 0 | -- |

**Aura:** 10' radius from you, affecting Targets of your choice within.
**Cone:** 15' cone Area in front of you.
**Cube:** 5' cube Area you can see.
**Glyph:** Creates a 5' square glyph on a Target you can see, where no other glyph is within Close. The Spell is Cast in a 5' cube from the glyph when you choose, then the glyph disappears.
**Imbue:** Targets a Weapon equipped by a willing Being within Far, which can then deliver the Spell as if by Touch if you spend 1 Mana to do so when the attack hits. The Attack Check is used for the Cast Check.
**Line:** 5' wide, 30' long, 10' tall Area. Expanding the width by 5' or height by up to 10' doubles the Cost.
**Remote:** An ambience or bolt on a Target.
**Sphere:** 5' radius sphere in sight.
**Touch:** A Close Target, or yourself.
## Duration
Spell damage is instant and the effects last until your next Turn, unless you Focus when you Cast it to sustain it until you stop the Focus. If the Spell includes an unwilling Being as a Target, you must spend 1 Mana and pass a Cast Check to keep the Focus each Round. Before you do, you can choose to also deal damage on the passed Check by spending additional Mana, dealing 1d6 per Mana spent to do so.

**Continual:** Continual duration doesn't require Focus, and lasts until ended (no Action).
## Example Cast Situation
> "I want to Cast [[Burn]] as a 15' radius sphere of flame with the effect, dealing 3d6 damage and keep the effect active."
>
> **Damage:** 2 Mana for additional damage.
> **Effect:** 1 Mana to add the Effect.
> **Delivery:** 4 Mana from the sphere's area.
> **Duration:** Focus (1 Mana each subsequent Turn).
> **Total:** 7 Mana, 1 Mana each Round to Focus for the effect if it Targets an unwilling Being. Can spend additional Mana to deal damage.
