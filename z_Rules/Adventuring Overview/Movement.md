Speed indicates how far something can Move on its Turn during [[Combat]] by walking. When using a battlemat for [[Combat]], each square equals 5' (2 meters). Heroes will have Encounter, Crawl, and Travel Speeds, detailed in the following Chapters.

### Falling
Falling onto a hard surface deals 1d6 per 10' fallen, to a maximum of 20d6 at 200', landing [[Prone]] if the damage is taken.

### Difficult Terrain
A Being spends 2' to Move 1' in Difficult Terrain. Some examples include:
- Climbable walls and squeezing in tight spots.
- Move in liquid deeper than half your height.
- Dense vegetation, rubble, and spiked rocks.
