Size describes the space something occupies. A Being can't Move through a Foe's space without special Abilities unless allowed or if it is at least two Sizes larger than the Foe.

### Size
*Ht. (Height), U.O. (Units Occupied).*

| Size | Ht. | U.O. | Size | Ht. | U.O. |
|------|-----|------|------|-----|------|
| Small | <3' | 1* | Huge | 21-40' | 5-9 |
| [[Medium]] | 3-10' | 1 | [[Giant]] | 41-60' | 10-16 |
| Large | 11-20' | 1-4 | Colossal | >60' | 17+ |

*\* Occupies this space, but doesn't prevent movement*

### Flanking
If at least two Allied Beings are Close to a Foe, the Foe is [[Vulnerable]] if it is no more than one size larger than the Allies.

### Grappling
Physically causing a Target to be [[Restrained]] by using your body is Grappling. A Being that is physically restraining a Target has its Speed halved, unless the Target is smaller. The methods for resolving this differ for Heroes and Enemies:

**Beginning a Grapple**
- **Heroes:** Attack Action and passed [[Brawl]] Check to begin the Grapple.
- **Enemies:** It can make a [[Melee]] Attack that Restrains, forcing a Save.

**Ending a Grapple**
- **Heroes:** Action to Save, ending the Grapple on a pass and regaining half their Speed.
- **Enemies:** Action to force the Hero to make a [[Brawl]] Check to maintain the Grapple. On a fail, the Grapple ends and the Enemy regains half its Speed.
