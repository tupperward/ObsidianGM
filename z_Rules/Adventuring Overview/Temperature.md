Each Shift a Being spends in Bitter Cold or Sweltering Heat will require an Endure Save. On a fail, it gains 1 Fatigue. Beings that are Immune to Cold damage automatically pass this Save in Bitter Cold. Similarly, Beings Immune to Fire damage automatically pass this Save in Sweltering Heat.

### Extreme Temperatures
Extreme environments may shorten the time for which these [[Saves]] are made. For example, moving through the inside of a volcano could call for the Check against Sweltering Heat every Hour or Scene; being in a plane of elemental fire might call for it every Round.
