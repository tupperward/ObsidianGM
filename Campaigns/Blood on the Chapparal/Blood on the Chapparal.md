  description: "Slivers are on the loose! \n\nWe find ourselves in n a quiet land still echoing with primal power. Deep in the western desert, nestled between two rushing branches of [[The Glowing Gulch]] and tucked beneath the shadow of [[Banagher Butte]] lies the peaceful town of [[Cairn Bluff]].\n\nA rogue group of arcanists and artificers, hired to help with the construction of [[The Clocktower]], have encountered a mysterious artifact and have become obsessed with doing....something to it. This brings a mysterious pale creature to the range."
  storycircle: 
    you: "The party doing chores for the people of [[Cairn Bluff]]"
    need: "But some arcanists and artificers from the community are missing"
    go: "They begin to find Clues as to why these few artificers are missing, but they need the help of the Goliaths to get a ride that far."
    search: "The trail leads down by [[the Glowing Gulch]], where the artificers were running their own experiments outside of their normal work beneath an abandoned and shattered tower."
    find: "The players discover a destroyed makeshift arcane laboratory in the [[Wasted Watchtower]], the only survivor a simulacrum of one of the missing artificers and arcanists. They find an object of power and a living being."
    take: "Disturbing the artifact in the lab or the creature will trigger many many more of the creatures arriving. They appear to be attracted to powerful leyline magicks."
    return: "Racing home to save the Clocktower from a horde of slivers, trying to beat a small herd travelling behind them."
    change: "Regardless of their feelings about the Clocktower, they must save it or have Oufoillia be overrun."
