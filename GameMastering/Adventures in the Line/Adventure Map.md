Slivers are on the loose! 

We find ourselves in n a quiet land still echoing with primal power. Deep in the western desert, nestled between two rushing branches of [[The Line]] and tucked beneath the shadow of [[Banagher Butte]] lies the peaceful town of [[Oufoillea]].

A rogue group of arcanists and artificers, hired to help with the construction of [[The Clocktower]], have encountered 

1. Players arrive in town
2. They are attracted to one of the Hooks
	1. Modrons interfering with the constuction of the Big Clock because the Arcansist they had a deal with is missing.
	2. Goliath dino herder injured not far from the Line, looks like a predator but nobody can agree on what
	3. Several artificers haven't come to work in a couple days and their tabs are unpaid at the Inn
