Elves are known for their tall height, ethereal beauty, and inquisitive passion to witness awe. This passion embodies itself in their clothing, language, arts, and cuisine, as elves seek to make every moment one worth savoring. Of all the peoples that inhabit the world, it is likely no other lives as peacefully and permissively with the fae, fauna, and flora as elves.
