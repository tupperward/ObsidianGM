# Quest: Ruinous League
*A Procedurally-Generated Solo/Co-Op Crawl for 1st to 4th-Level Heroes*

In ages past, a leyline carved its way through the cliffsides 8 miles south of Llerirell, marked by a set of ancient ruins. This hotspot of natural mana spawns forth an ever-shifting dungeon full of twisted monsters every day, with a new layout that grows within the cliff.

The ruins are something of a tourist attraction for daring adventurers hoping to test their mettle against the anomaly. Not only do the ruins shift daily, anything that enters the dungeon and dies is seemingly resurrected at a shrine built in Llerirell. Adventurers can find work delving the ruins to find loot, but must take caution, as the dungeon is only open for 6 hours each day before imploding.

The ruins are filled with dangers, including traps and stashes of the mage's plunders. Will you answer the call to adventure?!?

## Hook & Play

Your objective is to bring back as much loot as possible, and potentially eliminate the horror that resides within the ever-changing ruins.

### Progress Clock

Track time in the dungeon on six 6-segment Progress Clocks. Each Scene adds a segment to the clock, and the dungeon collapses once all have filled, killing outsiders within.

### Dying in the Dungeon

Any Beings foreign to the dungeon are resurrected in Llerirell at the next dawn. They gain the benefits of a Rest and don't gain Fatigue from dying this way.

### General Interactions

- **Backtrack:** Continue checking for Random Encounters, but don't advance the Progress Clock by moving this way.
- **Doors:** The doors are wood (8 HP, Armor: 1 [as Wood]). Each attempt to damage a door advances the Progress Clock by 1.
- **Tracking:** You can attempt to find Enemies by making a [[Survival]] Check during a Scene. If you pass, you discover tracks leading towards your next unexplored area. You know there is an Encounter and can surprise those Enemies.
