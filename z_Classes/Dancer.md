## Features
---
### [[Fleet of Foot]]
*Dancer: 1st Level*
You gain the [[Treads Lightly]] Perk, and the roll for you to Crit on Reflex [[Saves]] is reduced by an amount equal to (your Dancer Level divided by 4, round up).

### [[Step Up]]
*Dancer: 1st Level*
Once per Turn, you can use your Action to perform an enlivening dance. Doing so allows you to roll a second d20 on Reflex [[Saves]] until the start of your next Turn and use the higher result, and it gives one Ally of your choice that sees you a second Action this Turn.

### [[Evasive (Dancer)]]
*Dancer: 2nd Level*
While you aren't [[Incapacitated]], you ignore Hinder on Reflex [[Saves]] and you ignore two of a Dodged attack's damage dice on a passed Save, rather than one.

### [[Don't Stop Me Now]]
*Dancer: 4th Level*
Your Speed is not affected by Difficult Terrain, and you have Favor on [[Saves]] against being [[Paralyzed]], [[Restrained]], or moved.

### [[Choreographer]]
*Dancer: 6th Level*
When you use your [[Step Up]] Feature, the Ally gains Favor on the first Check they make with the Action you give them, and you both gain a 10' bonus to Speed for the Round.

### [[Flash of Beauty]]
*Dancer: 8th Level*
When you Crit on a Save, you can take two Actions, rather than one.

### [[Double Time]]
*Dancer: 10th Level*
You can Target two Allies with your [[Step Up]] Feature, rather than one.
