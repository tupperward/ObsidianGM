## Features
---
### [[Gold Sink]]
*Merchant: 1st Level*
You gain the [[Deft Hands]] Perk, and can take the Use Action to place nonmagical valuables into a container and close it. You can then open that container to have the valuables magically changed into an Item of equal or lesser value to the valuables placed in it. This Item can't be a Relic or similar magic item.

### [[Deep Pockets]]
*Merchant: 1st Level*
You have an extra number of Item Slots equal to (half your Merchant Level, round up).

### [[Bang for Your Buck]]
*Merchant: 2nd Level, 8th Level*
When you use an Item with limited uses, you can spend 1 [[Luck]] and roll a d10. If the result is lower than your remaining [[Luck]], the Item is not expended. When you become an 8th Level Merchant, the d10 is a d8.

### [[Diamond Hands]]
*Merchant: 4th Level*
You can spend a Shift to remove one Power from a non-Fabled Relic or expend valuables in your possession of equal or higher value to the Power to add it to an Item.

### [[Treasure Seeker]]
*Merchant: 6th Level*
You can sense gold, gems, and Relics within Near as if by Telepathy. This sense is specific enough to tell you where they are, but not what they are.

### [[Top Shelf]]
*Merchant: 10th Level*
Once per week, you can pull a Relic from your [[Gold Sink]] Feature with a value no higher than (your Merchant Level x 200g), otherwise obeying all the rules for using that Feature.
