## Features

### [[Spellstriker]]
*Magus: 1st Level*
You gain the [[Gish]] Perk and can Cast Spells using [[Arcana]].

**Spells:** You learn 2 Spells, one of which must always be [[Ward]]. You learn 1 other Spell every 3 Magus Levels hereafter.

**Mana:** Your Maximum Mana is equal to (2 x your Magus Level), and the highest amount of Mana you can spend to Cast a Spell is equal to (Reason + half your Magus Level, round up). You regain spent Mana when you [[Rest]].

### [[Esoteric Eye]]
*Magus: 1st Level*
If you can see a Target, you can use your Action or skip your Move to learn if any magic is currently affecting it. You can do so once per Shift, but you can spend 1 Mana to do so again.

### [[Spell Parry]]
*Magus: 2nd Level*
You can Block Casts that include you as a Target if it either calls for a Reflex Save or has a delivery of Touch or Remote. If you Crit to Block a Cast, you can dispel the effect.

### [[Arcane Recall]]
*Magus: 4th Level*
You can use your Action to open your esoteric eye of recall, allowing you to change one of your Spells Known that isn't [[Ward]]. You can't do so again until you [[Rest]] or take 1 Fatigue to do so.

### [[Spell Surge]]
*Magus: 6th Level, 10th Level*
If you pass a Check to Block a Cast by 10 or more, you can reflect the Cast back at the Caster. When you become a 10th Level Magus, it triggers if you pass by 8 or more.

### [[Aegis Obscura]]
*Magus: 8th Level*
You and the Target of your [[Ward]] Spell have Allsight and take half damage from magic-based sources.
