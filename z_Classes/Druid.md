### [[Primal Mystic]]
*Druid: 1st Level*
You can Cast Spells using [[Mysticism]].

**Spells:** You learn 4 Spells, one of which must always be [[Polymorph]]. You learn 1 other Spell every 2 Levels in this Class hereafter.

**Mana:** Your Maximum Mana is equal to (4 x your Druid Level), and the highest amount of Mana you can spend to Cast a Spell is equal to (Awareness + half your Druid Level, round up). You regain spent Mana when you [[Rest]].

### [[Feral Shift]]
*Druid: 1st Level*
You get the [[Shapechanger]] Perk and you can take an Action granted by the [[Beast]] you turn into as a part of the Cast Action.

### [[Tempest Within]]
*Druid: 2nd Level*
You reduce Cold, Fire, and Shock damage you take by (half your Druid Level) per damage die.

### [[Innervate]]
*Druid: 4th Level*
You can use your Action to give a Close Being some of your Mana, or to end one Status affecting it from either [[Charmed]], [[Confused]], [[Frightened]], or [[Sickened]]. This can be yourself.

### [[Ancient Growth]]
*Druid: 6th Level*
While you Focus on a Casting of [[Polymorph]] that only Targets yourself, you can Focus one additional Spell. Further, your attacks as Beasts you polymorph into count as (+1) Relics. This bonus increases every 6 Druid Levels hereafter.

### [[Savagery]]
*Druid: 8th Level*
While you are polymorphed into a [[Beast]], you have a +1 bonus to [[Armor]].

### [[Force of Nature]]
*Druid: 10th Level*
If you are reduced to 0 HP, roll a d10. If the result is equal to or lower than your Awareness, you are instead at 1 HP.
