### [[Glamour]]
*Sorcerer: 1st Level*
You can Cast Spells using [[Influence]].

**Spells:** You learn 4 Spells. You learn 1 other Spell every 2 Sorcerer Levels hereafter.

**Mana:** Your Maximum Mana is equal to (4 x your Sorcerer Level), and the highest amount of Mana you can spend to Cast a Spell is equal to (Presence + half your Sorcerer Level, round up). You regain spent Mana when you [[Rest]].

### [[Tap]]
*Sorcerer: 1st Level*
You gain the [[Metamagic]] Perk.

Further, when you Cast, you can reduce your Max HP to regain Mana equal to (2 x the reduction). This reduction ends when you [[Rest]]. If you die from this reduction, the Cast resolves before your death, and your body is vaporized.

### [[Spell-Slinger]]
*Sorcerer: 2nd Level*
You Crit on Cast Checks on a roll of 19 to 20, and your Spells use a d8 damage die, rather than a d6.

### [[Quickening]]
*Sorcerer: 4th Level*
You can skip your Move to Cast a Spell. No Mana can be spent on this Casting.

### [[Arcane Anomaly]]
*Sorcerer: 6th Level*
You reduce damage you take from magic-based sources by half.

### [[Spell Twinning]]
*Sorcerer: 8th Level*
If you Cast the same Spell twice on a Turn, the second Cast Check is Favored.

### [[Overpowered]]
*Sorcerer: 10th Level*
You Crit on Cast Checks on a roll of 18 to 20.

Further, when you Cast, you can choose to gain 2 Fatigue. If you do, you regain Cd6 Mana at the start of your Turns, and you can spend as much Mana as you like to Cast.
