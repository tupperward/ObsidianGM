Barbarians are primal warriors that fight with the power of unbridled anger. The legends speak of their kills almost as their own unique deeds, using the barbarian's name as a past-tense verb.

## Features
---
### [[Rage]]
*Barbarian: 1st Level*
While [[Berserk]] and wearing [[Light]] [[Armor]] or no [[Armor]], you reduce damage you take by 1 per damage die, and your attack damage dice are one size larger and can Explode.
Further, you can go [[Berserk]] after you take damage or as part of making an attack. You remain [[Berserk]] this way for 1 minute, unless you end it (no Action) or go [[Unconscious]].

### [[Wrath]]
*Barbarian: 1st Level*
You gain the [[Interceptor]] Perk, and can make its attack against an Enemy that makes a [[Ranged]] Attack, Casts, or that damages you or an Ally.

### [[Aggressor]]
*Barbarian: 2nd Level*
You have a 10' bonus to Speed during the first Round of [[Combat]], and having 3 or more Fatigue doesn't prevent you from taking the Rush Action.

### [[Fearmonger]]
*Barbarian: 4th Level*
When you kill an Enemy, every Near Enemy with HD lower than your Level becomes [[Frightened]] until the end of your next Turn.

### [[Mindless Rancor]]
*Barbarian: 6th Level*
You can't be [[Charmed]], [[Confused]], or compelled to act against your will.

### [[Bloodthirsty]]
*Barbarian: 8th Level*
Your attacks against Beings that are missing any HP are Favored, and you can sense them within Far as if by Blindsight.

### [[Rip and Tear]]
*Barbarian: 10th Level*
While [[Berserk]], you reduce damage you take by 2 per damage die, rather than 1, and you gain a +1 bonus to each die of damage you deal.
