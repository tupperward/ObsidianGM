*[[Witch]]: 1st Level*

You can choose for the effects of a Spell you Cast (not the damage) to become continual for one of the Targets until you use this Feature on a different Target. This does not require your Focus. The number of Spells you can have as continual this way at the same time is equal to (half your [[Witch]] Level, round up).
