*[[Merchant]]: 1st Level*

You gain the [[Deft Hands]] Perk, and can take the Use Action to place nonmagical valuables into a container and close it. You can then open that container to have the valuables magically changed into an Item of equal or lesser value to the valuables placed in it. This Item can't be a Relic or similar magic item.
