*[[Gunslinger]]: 2nd Level*

Once per Round, you can make a [[Ranged]] attack on an Off-Turn to Target a projectile from an attack you can see. If you pass, reduce the damage of the triggering attack by the damage you would deal with your attack. The projectile falls out of the air if reduced to 0.
