*[[Pugilist]]: 1st Level*

While only using [[Brawl]] [[Weapons]], you can use a d4 if the damage was previously lower and, once per Round, you can spend half your Speed to make a second attack rather than skip your Move.

Additionally, if you have Favor on a [[Brawl]] Attack Check and hit a Target you could viably Grapple or Shove, you can choose to Grapple or Shove them.
