*[[Barbarian]]: 1st Level*

While [[Berserk]] and wearing [[Light]] [[Armor]] or no [[Armor]], you reduce damage you take by 1 per damage die, and your attack damage dice are one size larger and can Explode.

Further, you can go [[Berserk]] after you take damage or as part of making an attack. You remain [[Berserk]] this way for 1 minute, unless you end it (no Action) or go [[Unconscious]].
