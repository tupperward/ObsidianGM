Rogues are the back-alley urchins, gutterborn scum, and shadowed assassins. To hammers, every problem looks like a nail. Rogues are blades, and every problem is a throat.

## Features
---
### [[Sneak Attack]]
*Rogue: 1st Level*
If your first attack on a Turn is Favored, it deals an extra d4 damage and ignores an amount of [[Armor]] equal to this number of extra dice.

The number of extra d4s increases by 1 every 3 Rogue Levels hereafter.

### [[Infiltrator]]
*Rogue: 1st Level*
You gain the [[Resourceful]] Perk, and you have Favor on Checks and [[Saves]] made to ambush and against traps that you are aware of.

### [[Unflinching Luck]]
*Rogue: 2nd Level, 8th Level*
When you spend [[Luck]] to gain Favor on a Check, roll a d12. If the result is lower than your remaining [[Luck]], the [[Luck]] is not spent. When you become an 8th Level Rogue, the d12 is a d10.

### Evasive (Rogue)
*Rogue: 4th Level*
While you aren't [[Incapacitated]], you ignore Hinder on Reflex [[Saves]] and you ignore two of a Dodged attack's damage dice on a passed Save, rather than one.

### [[Lethal Weapon]]
*Rogue: 6th Level*
Your [[Sneak Attack]] applies to any Favored attacks you make on a Turn, not just the first.

### [[Waylay]]
*Rogue: 10th Level*
Once per Round, if you kill an Enemy during a Turn, you can immediately take one Action.
