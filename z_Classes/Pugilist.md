Pugilists are brawlers of swagger. While a monk may dedicate themself to a single focused blow, a pugilist will break their fingers and keep punching with the bloody stump.

## Features

### [[Fisticuffs]]
*Pugilist: 1st Level*
While only using [[Brawl]] [[Weapons]], you can use a d4 if the damage was previously lower and, once per Round, you can spend half your Speed to make a second attack rather than skip your Move.

Additionally, if you have Favor on a [[Brawl]] Attack Check and hit a Target you could viably Grapple or Shove, you can choose to Grapple or Shove them.

### [[Rope-a-Dope]]
*Pugilist: 1st Level*
You gain the [[Check Hook]] Perk and can make two attacks with it, rather than one.

### [[Beat Rush]]
*Pugilist: 2nd Level*
If you take the Rush Action, you can also make one attack with a [[Brawl]] Weapon.

### [[Prowess]]
*Pugilist: 4th Level*
If you pass a Save to Block, you ignore two of the highest rolled damage dice, rather than one.

### [[Haymaker]]
*Pugilist: 6th Level, 10th Level*
If you pass a [[Brawl]] Attack Check by 10 or more, the Target is [[Dazed]] until your next Turn. When you become a 10th Level Pugilist, it triggers if you roll 8 or more.

### [[Impact]]
*Pugilist: 8th Level*
You use a d6 for the damage die of your [[Brawl]] [[Weapons]].
