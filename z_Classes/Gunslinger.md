## Features

### [[Quick Draw]]
*Gunslinger: 1st Level*
You gain the [[Marksmanship]] Perk and, when [[Combat]] occurs, you can make one [[Ranged]] attack before the first Turn, which is Hindered if it is made with a 2H Weapon.

### [[Deadeye]]
*Gunslinger: 1st Level*
After you pass a [[Ranged]] Check, you Crit on subsequent [[Ranged]] attacks on a d20 roll 1 lower, but no lower than 17. This resets to 0 at the end of your Turn if you didn't pass a [[Ranged]] Check since your last Turn.

### [[Skeet Shooter]]
*Gunslinger: 2nd Level*
Once per Round, you can make a [[Ranged]] attack on an Off-Turn to Target a projectile from an attack you can see. If you pass, reduce the damage of the triggering attack by the damage you would deal with your attack. The projectile falls out of the air if reduced to 0.

### [[Grit]]
*Gunslinger: 4th Level*
When you Crit on a [[Ranged]] attack, the damage dice can Explode.

### [[Devastator]]
*Gunslinger: 6th Level*
When you reduce an Enemy to 0 HP, the roll on the d20 to Crit as per your [[Deadeye]] Feature is immediately set to 17.

### [[Bad Medicine]]
*Gunslinger: 8th Level*
You deal an extra die of damage when you Crit with a [[Ranged]] Check.

### [[High Noon]]
*Gunslinger: 10th Level*
Once per Turn, if you Crit on a [[Ranged]] Check, you can make one additional attack.
