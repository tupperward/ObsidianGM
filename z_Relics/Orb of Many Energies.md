**Lore:** Relic Trinket (Orb, Bound)

Roll a d8 to determine its starting color. Each color corresponds to a Spell, which the Bound Being can Cast as long as the orb is that color by spending a Charge.

Whenever you Cast a Spell that corresponds to the orb's current color, roll a d8 to determine its new color.

| d8 | [[Color]] | Spell |
|----|-------|-------|
| 1 | Red | [[Burn]] |
| 2 | Orange | [[Amplify]] |
| 3 | Yellow | [[Zap]] |
| 4 | Green | [[Sprout]] |
| 5 | Blue | [[Freeze]] |
| 6 | Indigo | [[Ward]] |
| 7 | Violet | [[Color]] |
| 8 | Special | The orb becomes two colors at once. Roll twice, rerolling 8s. When you Cast a Spell corresponding to either of these colors, you may Cast the Spell corresponding to the other color as a part of the same Action. |

The orb has Cd6 Charges. When it runs out of Charges, it dims to a grayish color and can't be used until the next dawn.

**Value:** 2500g
