**Lore:** Relic Spear (Bound)

Spear with a banneret's standard capable of instilling bravery. It has the following Powers:
- **Warlord's Resolve:** While planted in the ground, Allies within Near have a +1 bonus to [[Armor]], and Favor on [[Saves]] against [[Frightened]].
- **Loyalty:** Can be thrown to attack. It then magically returns to the Wielder's hand after the attack.
- **[[Glamour]]:** The standard can change to a design of the Bound Being's choice. It never gets dirty.
