**Lore:** Fabled Relic Alchemical Item (Bound)

The philospher's stone is a mystical object made from the essence of creation itself. It can form all materials when used by an alchemist.

While within 1 mile of the stone, the bound Being does not age and can't be [[Sickened]].

The stone is an alchemical item that can be used with the Use Action in the following ways, which consumes the Philosopher's Stone in the process:
- If it touches a corpse, it is revived, and heals, creates, or regenerates their body to its original form if the Fates allow.
- It provides up to 50g of raw materials suitable for making an alchemical item. These raw materials disappear after 1 week of their creation.
