**Lore:** Relic Book

A spellbook functions as a Trinket and contains the knowledge of how to Cast at least one Spell. The Spell can be Cast from it by the person who created it without issue. Otherwise, it requires the reader to pass an [[Arcana]] Check to do so. If the [[Arcana]] Check is a 1, the spellbook dissolves.

**Value:** 25g
