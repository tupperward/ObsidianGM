name: Relic List
type: relic
---
Relics have a property called their Lore, a summary of the kind of Item it is, and whether or not it is Fabled and therefore truly unique to most worlds.

**Fabled:** Only one of these exists in the realms, and it has a history with someone or something of legend (such as a warrior revered as a demigod or primal dragon). Kingdoms may very well wage war over the posession of one of these Relics, and they can't be Combined. It typically requires a wish or very specific method to destroy it.

**Bound:** You must be Bound to some Relics to control their Powers. You do so as a Ritual performed over 10 minutes (one Scene) with the Relic. Only one Being can be bound to the same Relic, and a Being can only be Bound to 3 Relics at a time.

**Consumables:** Any Consumable Relic is used up by its use. These grant an immediate or temporary benefit, and are likely 10% as valuable as Relics with permanent Powers.

**Cursed Relics:** When a Being bonds to a Relic that is cursed, that Relic is permanently Bound to them until the curse is removed. Doing so typically requires a Ritual performed as a Shift by a spellcaster of at least 5th Level.

**Crafting Relics:** Relics can be Crafted over the course of several Shifts. Doing so requires the time, Materials, and--in the case of some Relics--a specific Material.

**Combining Powers:** There may be some means for Heroes to combine Relics, typically through a legendary blacksmith or extremely powerful ritual. In these cases, the following rules apply:
- Relics can only be combined with others of the same Type. For example, a Weapon and a Weapon could be combined, but a Weapon and [[Armor]] can't.
- Bonuses are not cumulative. For example, combining a +2 Weapon with a +1 Weapon will create a +2 Weapon, not a +3 Weapon.
- Combining can't remove Bound requirement.
