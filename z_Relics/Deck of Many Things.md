**Lore:** Fabled Tarot Card Deck

Deck of 22 cards in a box. Each card depicts an esoteric image and is decorated with filigree of magical glyphs. A Being can draw up to 4 cards from the deck, and is affected by the magic effects of the card. Afterward, those cards return to the deck.

You can use a deck of Tarot cards to represent the Deck, using only the Major [[Arcana]] to represent it. Those cards are indicated in parenthesis.

- **Balance (Justice):** Any three Relics of their choice with a bonus increase the bonus by 1.
- **Comet (The World):** By themselves, they must defeat the next Enemy they encounter to gain a Level.
- **Donjon (The Empress):** They drop their inventory, forget how to Cast any Spells, and are teleported to a prison. The deck then disappears and no cards can be drawn.
- **Fates (The Lovers):** They can choose to avoid one situation or the outcome of a situation at one point in the future.
- **Flames (The Devil):** A powerful Hellspawn takes a dedicated interest in them. It is now their Enemy, and will seek to ruin their life.
- **Fool (The Fool):** They lose 1 Level and draw another card. The Fool disappears forever.
- **Gem (The Wheel of Fortune):** (d66) gems worth 100g each and (d66) pieces of jewelry worth 200g each appear around them.
- **Idiot (Temperance):** Their Reason decreases by d6. If reduced to 0, they die. They can draw another card.
- **[[Jester]] (The Hierophant):** They gain 1 Level or draw two cards. The [[Jester]] disappears from the deck forever.

- **[[Moon]] (The [[Moon]]):** They gain three wishes, which must be made within 10 minutes.
- **[[Rogue]] (The Hanged Man):** A friend to them now permanently hates them. This hatred is only revealed at the worst possible time.
- **Ruin (The Tower):** They lose all of their land, possessions, and wealth.
