Wind shears blast the Target in the following ways:

**Feather:** If Cast on a falling Target, this blast can slow the descent of a falling [[Medium]] or smaller Target to a safe Speed for the duration.

**Target:** This can push an Item that occupies 1 or less Slots, or a Being with Level or HD 1 or lower. You can increase this number by spending additional Mana on the Cast, increasing it by 1 per Mana spent to do so.

**Distance:** This pushes the Target 5', and you can increase the distance pushed by spending Mana, increasing the distance by 5' per Mana spent to do so.
