You animate an Item that occupies no more than 1 Slot in the Area or carried by the Target.

For the duration, the Item gains a Speed of 30' (Fly), and uses the Object [[Armor]] & HP rules for its Stats. It obeys your commands, which you can issue when you Focus on this Spell. If it is a Weapon, it can make Attacks using your Cast Skill.
