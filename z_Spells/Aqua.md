This Spell can create and destroy fresh water in the following ways:

**Area:** The space within is emptied or filled with water. If the Area is occupied by a Being, this requires a Cast Check. You choose if this water remains or dries up after the duration.

**Target:** This can push an Item that occupies 1 or less Slots, or a Being with Level or HD 1 or lower. You can increase this number by spending additional Mana on the Cast, increasing it by 1 per Mana spent to do so.

**Distance:** This pushes the Target 5', and you can increase the distance pushed by spending Mana, increasing the distance by 5' per Mana spent to do so.
