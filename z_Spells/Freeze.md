Any freestanding water in the Area is frozen. If the Target is a Being, its Speed is reduced by 10'. Alternatively, you can create an Object made of ice that can fit within the Area, and is of a shape of your choice (such as an icicle dagger or a block of ice). If needed, the Object has HD: 1 (4 HP) and is Weak: Fire.

Any of these effects last for the duration.

Crit: Duration is continual.
