If you spend a Shift taming and training a non-hostile [[Beast]] with a HD count no higher than (half your Level), you can have it follow you as a companion. You control it by commanding it with your Action or by skipping your Move. Otherwise, it instinctually attacks your Enemies. It uses your [[Survival]] Difficulty for Checks. You can only have one such companion at a time.
