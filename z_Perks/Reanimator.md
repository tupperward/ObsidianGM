You can perform a 10-minute Ritual with the corpse of a Being that is not an Artificial or Undead, and that has HD no higher than your Level. Doing so raises it as an Undead as per the [[Raise]] Spell. It is under your control for one Shift, or until you perform this Ritual again. It uses either your [[Arcana]], [[Craft]], or [[Mysticism]] Skill for Checks and [[Saves]].
