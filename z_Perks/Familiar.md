You can conduct a 10-minute Ritual to conjure a familiar, a loyal Ally to you that you control. The familiar can be any Small Being with HD: 1. It uses your Cast Skill for Checks and [[Saves]], and you can Cast Spells from the familiar as if it were originating from you.

The familiar is banished when it drops to 0 HP or if you conduct this Ritual again to create another familiar.
