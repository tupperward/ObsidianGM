You can take the Cast Action to conjure a Summon, which is a non-Humanlike Being you have previously defeated with HD equal to or lower than your Level, spending Mana to do so equal to the Summon's HD. You must conduct a 10-minute Ritual to choose which Being is your Summon before taking this Action.

The following rules apply to your Summon:
- It is an Ally that obeys your commands, which you issue as an Action or by skipping your Move.
- It uses your Cast Skill for Checks and [[Saves]].
- You must Focus on the Summon, spending 1 Mana per Turn while it is conjured. Otherwise, the Summon is banished. When it is reduced to 0 HP or if you conjure another Summon, it is banished.
- Whenever it is banished, any Abilities that would end on its death end.
