**Type:** Potion

The consumer gains the ability to control a type of Being they can see for 1 Hour, which requires their Focus. The type of Being is determined by the name of the potion.

Once a Being is chosen, the consumer must make a Will Save. On a pass, the Being is [[Charmed]] and under their control for the duration. A Being controlled this way will not obey commands that clearly cause harm to itself. After this time, the Being becomes Hostile.

| [[Beast]] | 25g |
| Person (Dwarves, Elves, Humans, Goblins) | 250g |
| Monster (Dragon, Plant, [[Giant]], Undead) | 1250g |
