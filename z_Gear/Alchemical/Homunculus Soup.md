**Type:** Concoction

A special mixture of clay, ash, mandrake root, and the alchemist's own blood. This soup creates a homunculus under the alchemist's control, and it uses their [[Craft]] Skill for any Checks it makes. If another homunculus is created from the same alchemist's blood, the oldest homunculus dies.
