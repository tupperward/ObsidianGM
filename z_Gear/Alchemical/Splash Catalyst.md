**Type:** Explosive

When combined with another alchemical item used to make attacks, the catalyst increases the item's volatility. If the item only Targets a single Being, you can instead Target a point within the same range. If you Pass, all Beings Close to the point are subjected to its effects as if they had been hit with it.
