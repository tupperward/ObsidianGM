**Type:** Oil

The oil can coat either a 5-foot-square area or a [[Medium]] or smaller Target for as long as 1 week unless washed off. While coated, the Target can then be ignited, causing it to be [[Burning]] (Cd6, unless doused). Other Beings that touch the flames take d6 damage, and are [[Burning]] (d6) while still in contact with the flame.

A full flask fuels a burning lantern for a Shift.
