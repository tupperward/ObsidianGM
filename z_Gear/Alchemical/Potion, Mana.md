**Type:** Potion

The consumer regains Mana equal to a number of d6 rolls determined by the Potion's Rank, plus a modifier equal to its Rank:

| Rank | Rolls | Value |
|------|-------|-------|
| Mana I | d6+1 | 7g 50s |
| Mana II | 2d6+2 | 15g |
| Mana III | 3d6+3 | 50g |

Once it regains Mana with one of these potions, it must regain Mana from a [[Rest]] to do so again.
