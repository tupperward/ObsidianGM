You start with 3g (300s) of Wealth. Choose any pack you like, or roll d66. Classes list recommended Starting Packs in their "Playing" section.

In addition to the Items listed, each Starting Pack also includes a backpack, bedroll, 5 days of rations, 2 torches, and a waterskin. You are assumed to begin the game with at least one set of casual clothes and a pouch, which don't count against your Starting Wealth.
